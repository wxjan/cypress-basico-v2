# cypress-basico-v2


Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing online school.

# Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.15.0 and 9.5.0 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

# Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

# Tests
Note: Before running the tests, make a copy of the cypress.env.example.json file as cypress.env.json, which in the real world, you would update with valid credentials.

The cypress.env.json file is included on .gitignore and you're safe that confidential info won't be versioned.

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viweport

# Desktop 
Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viweport.

# Mobile

Run 'npm run test:mobile' to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport
